        <h2>Hello and welcome to my portfolio !</h2><br>
            <p>Iâ€™m an artist, currently studying software engineering, a future game dev, and an ai enthusiast.<br>
            My name is Inka, but online I mostly go by Dog. That name came to be as an accident, but stuck <br>
             after I started making friends while I was too lazy to change it.<br></p>
